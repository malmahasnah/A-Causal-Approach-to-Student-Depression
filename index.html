        <h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health disorders have always been and continue to be a major concern
          in people's lives. In the US, <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-student-mental-health-statistics/">
          at least 28% of college students</a> were diagnosed with depression or another
          mood disorder. Additionally, <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-student-mental-health-statistics/">
          more than 9 in 10 students</a> who face academic challenges say these challenges 
          affect their mental health. The goal of our project is to use causal knowledge to
          establish a framework for the root causes of depression, specifically in students.

          <h3>The Data</h3>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          <h3>Feature Selection using LASSO</h3>
        <p>
          The dataset had 111 indiviudal features, so we had to choose a subset of them we would focus on. We used LASSO feature selection to pick the most variables that will tell us the most information on a depressed individual.
          LASSO regression is used to select features because of how it zeroes out coefficients that are not as important. It minimizes a cost function that uses Mean Squared Error and a L1 penalty term, found by summing the absolute
          values of the coefficiences multiplied by a lambda.

          <h3>Peter-Clark (PC) Algorithm</h3>
          <p> 
            We used the Peter-Clark algorithm for causal discovery, to try and identify the underlying cause-and-effect relationships from our observational data.
            PC algorithm first starts with a complete, undirected graph with all variables connected. Then, it goes through and recursively deletes edges based on conditional independence decisions.
            If we look at an edge between A and B, if there is a set S without A and B, then we remove that edge, if this is true when S, A, and B are independent.

            Peter-Clark Algorithm can be used with different independence tests to find true independence relationships.
