        <h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Mental health disorders have always been and continue to be a major concern
          in people's lives. In the US, <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-student-mental-health-statistics/">
          at least 28% of college students</a> were diagnosed with depression or another
          mood disorder. Additionally, <a href="https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-student-mental-health-statistics/">
          more than 9 in 10 students</a> who face academic challenges say these challenges 
          affect their mental health. The goal of our project is to use causal knowledge to
          establish a framework for the root causes of depression, specifically in students.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          One of the main difficulties in understanding depression is differentiating
          its causes and its outcomes. The main goal of the project is to understand
          the causal relationships between certain factors and depression, and in
          doing so laying a framework as to what factors are most important to focus
          on in order to prevent the onset of depression.

          The data we are using contains a variety of factors about students and their 
          lives. These data points include, but are not limited to, their quantity of sleep, 
          financial stress level, academic pressure, academic success, their current level 
          of schooling and whether or not they are depressed. This data will work well for 
          our goal, as much of the data is very much under the control of the students. 
          Focusing our efforts on data such as dietary habits and profession can allow us 
          to help students make more informed decisions. Ultimately helping them better 
          understand how to combat depression by identifying potential risk factors, seeking 
          support systems as appropriate, and most importantly taking measures to target 
          specific lifestyle factors to prevent depression.

          Past studies such as "Causal Factors of Anxiety and Depression in College Students: 
          Longitudinal Ecological Momentary Assessment and Causal Analysis Using PCMCI" have 
          attempted to utilize methods such as the Peter and Clark algorithm to identify 
          significant factors. While this approach is close to ours, we will also use the Fast 
          KCI method for non-linear dependencies and incorporate counterfactual policy evaluation 
          to investigate how changes in certain variables could impact depression outcomes. 
          In addition to this, we will incorporate more modifiable lifestyle factors, as opposed 
          to ones they focused on such as self-esteem.
